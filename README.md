# A flask tutorial 
This is a leanring repo of flask and SQLAlchemy.  
The frontend is based on HTML and backend using Flask.  
In this repo, we would learn a Blog web using Flask, the functionality we would use are Flask forms, Flask login, Flask route.  
We would also learn about the SQLAlchemy database, on how to create the database and how to use it within the flask project.

## How to run?
There is a requirement.txt within the folder, you may need to create a virtual environment or directly install them on your PC.  
I would recommend using Anaconda or Python Venv, these are the tutorial links:  
[Learn python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)  
[Learn Anaconda venv](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)  
After setting up the environment and install necessary packages using  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
Enter your virtual environment, and run  
`pyhton run.py`  
Then if the command line does not report any error, in any of browser you prefered, type `http://127.0.0.1:5000/home`, you shall see the blog website now, enjoy your journey exploring the web!  
There is a file **user.txt**, you could login with these existing users!
